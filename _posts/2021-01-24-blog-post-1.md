Isotherms obatined by GCMC simulations (RASPA2.0)
Saturation loading predicted by Machine learning (xgboost, et al)            
Vacuum swing adsorption simulated by python and matlab (ideal & high-fidelity)                                   

### Part 1. RASPA          

### Part 2. Machine learning             

### Part 3. VSA simulations
